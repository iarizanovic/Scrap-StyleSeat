Over the next few years I continued to develop my skills and gain experience in my craft and creations. Upon continuing my education, I also completing all phases of Cosmetology and graduated from CHBA and received  my VA State Board Cosmetology License in 2002. From there going on to work for JCP Salon for 6yrs. Over 9yrs until today, I have worked for different companies as well as a self employer.

My name is Ashley, I'm a single mom of four and I have a grandson. I went to cosmetology school at Paul Mitchell in Fayetteville, NC. I graduated August 2021 and I'm so proud of myself. I faced a lot of obstacles during my journey, to the point where I thought that I had no other choice but to give up but God said NO! It was tough on me but my kids were definitely my motivation. Since a little girl, my dream was to be a hairstylist. I dropped out of school at the age of 16 and started having babies. I really thought my life was over, and that being a hairstylist was long gone for me. At age 33, I went back to school to get my GED and I did just that. I was so proud of myself. Afterwards, I checked into cosmetology \n at different schools. The school I was really interested in, was, of course, Paul Mitchell so that's the route I decided to take. I'm in disbelief, still, that I accomplished my childhood dream. It feels so unreal because I never in a million years would of thought that I'd actually be a cosmetologist. It brings me so much joy to know that Im the reason \nmy clients look and  feel special.  I just love what I do and who I do it for, which is my clients. As of now, I'm focusing on building my clientele and that itself, is hard work but I'm not giving up.\nMessage","Ashley  Mitchell\n5329 Yadkin Rd B \nFayetteville, NC 28303\n9106008815 ","https://maps.google.com/maps?q=5329%20Yadkin%20Rd%2C%20B%2C%20Fayetteville%2C%20NC%2C%2028303","Top Services\nColor Correction\nHighlighted\n$125 +\n·\n3 hr 0 min\nSee Times\nServices\n(25)\nBang Trim\n$10 \n·\n15 min\nSee Times\nAdd face framing-detail to your look with a bang trim.\nBlowout\n$55 \n·\n1 hr 0 min\nSee Times\nEnjoy a wash, blow dry, and fresh-from-the-salon confidence.\nFlat Iron\n$30 \n·\n1 hr 0 min\nSee Times\nGet your hair silky smooth and straight with a flat iron.\nMen's Cut\n$25 \n·\n30 min\nSee Times\nCarve shape and style into your hair with a fresh cut.\nSilk Press\n$70 \n·\n1 hr 30 min\nSee Times\nSmooth and straighten natural hair with a silk press.

These products are formulated with potent ingredients that help to nourish, hydrate, and firm the skin.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Yonka Optimizer Lift Facial Treatment is the application of a specialized modeling mask. This mask is carefully applied to the face and neck, and it works to tighten and lift the skin. It also helps to soothe and calm the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and revitalized.\n\nDuring the treatment, the esthetician will perform various massage techniques to stimulate blood circulation, promote lymphatic drainage, and enhance the absorption of the products. These techniques not only provide a relaxing experience but also help to tone and sculpt the facial muscles.\n\nThe Yonka Optimizer Lift Facial Treatment is known for its instant results. After the treatment, you can expect to see a noticeable improvement in the firmness and elasticity of your skin. Your complexion will appear more lifted, toned, and radiant.\n\nIt is recommended to receive this facial treatment regularly to maintain the optimal results.

This facial treatment uses a combination of specialized techniques and high-quality Yonka products to target the signs of aging and improve the overall appearance of the skin.\n\nThe treatment begins with a thorough cleansing of the face to remove any impurities and prepare the skin for the following steps. This is often followed by a gentle exfoliation to remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover.\n\nNext, a specific Yonka serum or concentrate is applied to the face, which is customized based on your skin's needs and concerns. These products are formulated with potent ingredients that help to nourish, hydrate, and firm the skin.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Yonka Optimizer Lift Facial Treatment is the application of a specialized modeling mask. This mask is carefully applied to the face and neck, and it works to tighten and lift the skin. It also helps to soothe and calm the skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and revitalized.\n\nDuring the treatment, the esthetician will perform various massage techniques to stimulate blood circulation, promote lymphatic drainage, and enhance the absorption of the products. These techniques not only provide a relaxing experience but also help to tone and sculpt the facial muscles.\n\nThe Yonka Optimizer Lift Facial Treatment is known for its instant results. After the treatment, you can expect to see a noticeable improvement in the firmness and elasticity of your skin. Your complexion will appear more lifted, toned, and radiant.\n\nIt is recommended to receive this facial treatment regularly to maintain the optimal results.

My mission is to help one see it!\n\nThank you for choosing Shalo Esthetics. I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Shamecka Shalo. I’ve been a Licensed Esthetician for 4 years. I started my journey as an esthetician to become a makeup artist. Once I enrolled and started taking classes I realized my love for skin had more to do with routine than covering up with makeup. I became obsessed with skin care Ingredients within products. As a person who have always struggled with acne skin,  I needed to know how ingredients can make a difference between flawed or flawless skin. My ultimate quest was to wear my own beautiful skin without feeling the need or pressure to put on makeup. So I begin to heal my skin. It took a little elbow grease but eventually I realized that I simply needed a routine. Within 3 months my skin was free of hyperpigmentation, and blemishes. I became more confident in how “I naturally looked” than how I “made myself to look”. Now don’t get me wrong, I still love makeup. The knowledge I have now has allowed me to fully understand makeup application for all skin types. Fast forward to 2022 I am on the quest to become better in My profession as an esthetician. Currently I am well rounded in just about everything in esthetics and I take pleasure in what I do. From facials to waxing, I enjoy it all! Thank you so much for considering Shalo Esthetics and I look forward to working with you in the near future!!

Brazilian waxing is now the most-requested waxing service in the spa industry. Many estheticians are thrown into the waxing room without proper knowledge and/or training on Brazilian waxing, leading to ingrown hairs and hyper pigmentation marks. Because of my experience and love for what I do I have created a nearly painless wax technique for my clients. \n\nAll eyebrows are not created equal.  \n\nYour  eyebrows are very personal brow sculpting should be done according to a individualized preference.  Come in and have a consultation and wax.  I am also a instructor of Esthetics and a Makeup Artist and have done hundreds of prom and wedding makeup applications. I am a person of detail and precision. Come in and enjoy the best wax you'll ever have, and schedule an appointment for all your beauty needs.\nMessage","Divine Creations Beauty Bar\n Private location!

This Skin Pen is safe for all skin types and promotes care-free healing to address acne scars, fine lines, and wrinkles. It can also be used to decrease the appearance of stretch marks. It's a fast and safe method that initiates the production of collagen and elastin in your skin.  How it works? Our bodies have natural processes that react to injury by producing new cells and extracellular materials (like elastin and collagen) to heal known as collagen induction. The SkinPen® initiates this natural process with a finely-tuned Microneedling pen by creating hundreds of temporary micro-sized openings in your skin. These small openings are created with the SkinPen®’s disposable needle cartridge, which achieves results without thermal energy or chemicals applied to the skin.\n\nWhile multiple sessions are typically recommended to achieve optimal results depending on your specific goals, noticeable changes can be seen just one week after treatment and gradually improve as the body’s healing process begins to take effect. Side effects are similar to a mild sunburn, such as redness, tenderness, and some swelling.\n* First time bookers 40% off\n*Friend referrals 20% per person\nFat Reduction / Body Countouring\n(1)\nLaser Lipo (body contouring)\n$30 \n·\n30 min\nSee Times\nApproved by FDA, this low lever laser targets fat removal from stubborn areas.
